# FlashCards Starter Kit

## Abstract 

The purpose of this project is to learn how JavaScript classes interact with one another. Having access to instantiate one class from another and be able to use the methods of both was a common theme. In total there are five classes, a card, a turn, a round, a deck and a game. They all had to interact to create a whole playable game!

## Game in action 



## Setup

Clone the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

Running `node index.js` from the root of your project should result in the following message being displayed in your terminal: 

```bash
Node server running on port 3000
```

From here the game can be played via the terminal, all questions can be selected using either the numbers on the keyboard or the arrow keys and submitted by using the return/enter key. When the game is running you will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer and will be given feedback. The game will run through the entire deck and give you your score in a percentage.
